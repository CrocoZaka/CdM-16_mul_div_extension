# Using with Python environments

If you installed `cdm-devkit` Python package to some managed environment (like venv or conda), you should do some more configuration.

+ Locate folder with Python scripts inside your environment
+ Grab full paths to `cocas` and `cocoemu-server` executables
+ In VS Code, go to `CdM Processors` extension settings
+ Fill in appropriate paths for `cocas` and `cocoemu-server`
